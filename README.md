# DSCWIRELESSKEYPAD

A wireless replacement for a DSC PC1555 keypad allows you to build a simple network interface to send key presses to your alarm and read the alarm status over the DSC Keybus.

Requres some circuitry in order to interface the Photon's 3V IO's to the DSC's 12V keybus signals.  Circuit is pretty simple, a hand full of resistors and a 4N25 opto-isolator.
